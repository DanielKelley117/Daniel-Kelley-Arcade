# Daniel-Kelley-Arcade
This is an Arcade that I made and built upon during one of my programming classes in college. It has four games, and uses 
three different programing languages.

##Automaton:
Automaton generates a DFA, and places the user in the start state. Throughout the DFA, the user must enter the correct input 
to get to the accept state. The user earns a certain amount of points depending on how many inputs it takes for them to 
get to the accept state. This game is written in C++.

##Programming Rumble:
Programming Rumble is a text based fighting game where the characters are programming languages. It heavily utilizes class 
inheritance. You play by selecting a character and an opponent. At the beginning of each round you can attack your opponent,
feed, which takes away hp in exchange for increasing your attack stat, or use your special ability, which performs a unique stat swap
for your character. You win if you can reduce your opponent's hp to 0 first.

##Four Corners:
This game is meant to be played in a group, and is written in Python. It uses a text to speech library called pyttsx3. You will need to 
install that library using pip to play this game.

##Weird Chess:
This is a text based adventure game that is written in Java. You go on a quest to rescue the princess from the Lizard Kingdom,
and have to play various mini games to complete the Quest.
